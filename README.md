## 🚀 Getting Started

> Flyway migrations run automatically — all tables will be created on first launch.

## 🛡️ Security

- Every request requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (except public endpoints)
- Short-lived access tokens are renewed via the refresh token endpoint
- Password changes require email verification before taking effect
- Soft-delete: deactivated users are marked with `isActive = false`
